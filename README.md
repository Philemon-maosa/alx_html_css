This is a CSS project created to practice and improve my web design skills using Cascading Style Sheets.<br> The main goal of the project is to style different HTML pages and elements to create visually appealing layouts and user-friendly interfaces.

In this project, I focused on learning and applying core CSS concepts such as colors, typography, spacing, positioning, and layout techniques.<br> I also explored more advanced topics like Flexbox, Grid, and media queries to make the design responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

The project includes multiple HTML pages linked together and styled consistently using an external CSS file.<br> Elements such as navigation menus, buttons, images, and forms are styled to enhance both the look and usability of the website.

This project helped me understand how CSS works in real-world scenarios and gave me hands-on experience <br>in writing clean, organized, and maintainable CSS code. I also practiced how to structure files properly by separating CSS from HTML and organizing assets like images into folders.

Overall, this CSS project is an important step in my journey to becoming a front-end web developer. <br>It showcases my ability to apply design principles and technical skills to build attractive and responsive web pages from scratch.
